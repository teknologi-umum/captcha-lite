# Very lightweight Telegram captcha bot written in Go

Some captcha bot on Telegram requires you to pay to be used on groups with 1000+ members.
Some is just so bad, bots can bypass through them.

We made something that's can't be bypassed by bots and free of cost.

The [full-version one](https://github.com/teknologi-umum/captcha) has more dependencies,
database connections (CockroachDB, MongoDB, and Redis), and a constant worker that logs
the group. Yet, it only runs on a free VM on [fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/)
which only has 1 shared vCPU, 3GB volume storage, and 256 MB of RAM.

Well, the point is: **if the full-blown version is running on a very low-end VM and still
be able to handle lots and lots of traffic (yes, we had an encounter of spam bots joining
our server before), this one should use even less resources!**

Late 2022 update: The bot now runs on a Linux VM on Docker, only using 10 MB of RAM with
1 shared vCPU.

## Deployment

Before you deploy the bot, you'll need to setup some environment variables to make
everything works. See [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

The easiest way to deploy the bot is through Docker.

```bash
docker run -e BOT_TOKEN="<telegram bot token>" -e ENVIRONMENT=production ghcr.io/teknologi-umum/captcha-lite:latest

# Or if you prefer the bleeding edge version
docker run -e BOT_TOKEN="<telegram bot token>" -e ENVIRONMENT=production ghcr.io/teknologi-umum/captcha-lite:edge
```

You can use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) to deploy the app.
We've provided the corresponding configuration file.

Or if you prefer to build everything from source.

```bash
# We assume you've installed Go 1.18 or higher (https://go.dev/dl)
go build .
./captcha-lite
```

Or run the `captcha-lite` binary file through systemd or supervisord.
